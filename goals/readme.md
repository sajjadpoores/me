# MY GOALS

## introduction
Here, I'm going to talk about my goals, in fact I think my goals are in several levels, there are some main goals which are very general and other goals are sub-goals of these goals.

## Main Goals
1. Finding my purpose in life.
2. Gain self-steem (enough to be able to give a speach in front of many many many people).
3. Do something great, create something useful to boost people's lives and be popular because of that.
4. Earn money enough to keep a healthy lifestyle, being able to experience most of enjoyable.
