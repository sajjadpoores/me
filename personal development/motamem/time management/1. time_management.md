# Time Management ⏰📈

Time management is a broad term that encompasses many challenges.

## Is Time Management Your True Need? 🤔

### The Danger of Overrating Certain Problems ❗️

It's easy to see a couple of issues as more significant than other weaknesses and problems, causing us to seek solutions for the wrong problem.

### Why Do We Have a Lack of Time Problem? 🤷‍♀️

Before we start managing our time, we need to diagnose the reason behind our lack of time. Here are some possible causes:

1. Having unrealistic goals and grandiose dreams 🌟
2. Weakness in decision-making and prioritization skills ❗️
   - Many of us have a phobia of decision-making and are afraid of eliminating options. For example, someone with a budget of 1 million toman may have two options: buying a 500k toman toy or a 600k toman toy. Instead of choosing one, they may borrow 100k toman and purchase both.
3. Weakness in delegating authority 👥
4. Perfectionism ✨
   - Perfectionists strive for a perfect score of 100 out of 100, rather than settling for a standard score of 90 or 95. Therefore, everything they do takes more time than usual.
5. Weakness in problem-solving skills ❗️
   - One reason for not having enough time is not having a procedural mindset and instead solving problems on a case-by-case basis. Instead of identifying the root of the problem, we spend our time searching for bad employees and punishing them. We choose friends who make us waste time and forget about prioritizing, and instead of addressing the root cause, we rely on different tools and techniques to manage our time.
6. Procrastination 🤦‍♀️
   - Sometimes our problem isn't time management, but it's procrastination and delaying work and tasks.
7. Weakness in saying no 🙅‍♀️
   - Some people find it difficult to say no, resulting in them spending most of their time doing things they've accepted due to shyness or similar reasons.
8. Weakness in energy management 🔋
   - We often fail to ask ourselves whether we should work hard for all the hours we are awake, or whether it's better to spend some time resting and rejuvenating so that our productivity increases.
